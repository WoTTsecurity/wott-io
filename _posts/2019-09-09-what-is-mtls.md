 * mTLS as a technology and means to communicate between server and device (particularly in IoT as it is lightweight) and link to WoTT articles securing mTLS examples 
 * what actually IS mTLS? Why is it useful as a means of security and the implications of not using
 

## How it works

 * popular uses of mTLS (SSH, IKE); encryption tool for major companies such as Skype
 * browsers don't use mTLS 
 * cryptographic identity 

## How to implement

 * WoTT has several handy guides on securing small apps using mTLS technologies (encourage users to do so)
 * Differs depending on technologies 

## Why you should care?
 
 * Outline the risks of NOT doing so
 * talk about security breaches as a result of not using mTLS
 * data is more and more precious - encryption necessary for privacy
 * not secure not to at this point

## Conclusions
